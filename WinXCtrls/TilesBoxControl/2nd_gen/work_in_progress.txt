This is 2nd generation of this project.
Because we encountered issues with previous design, we've changed our concepts all together.

Now there is one container, that is base for non-windowed controls, which are placed on it.
Controls are heavely redesigned, to be drawn on the base container.
All events are processed by base container and distributed to controls accordingly.

Wait until all code is good enough to be published, 
to have Windows 10 start menu looking like component in Your Delphi application for free.
